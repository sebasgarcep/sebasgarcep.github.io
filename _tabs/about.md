I'm a Data Engineer from the lovely city of Barranquilla, Colombia 🇨🇴. I love building data pipelines and mining data for insights. The main tools in my kit are SQL, Python, Javascript (NodeJS), Java and Spark. I also like building user interfaces in React and React Native. In my spare time you can find me geeking about tech and math 🤓, Reading 📖, Boxing 🥊 or playing Pokemon 🎮.
