Data science has been all the rage for a while. This is no accident: data science, done well, provides insights that give businesses the competitive edge you need nowadays to survive. What very few ever stop to think about is the infrastructure needed to perform data science at scale. Often, data is held in legacy databases or disparate data sources. Data is also often dirty, i.e. it is not suitable for data science workloads. It is the **Data Engineer**'s job to build this infrastructure in the first place, and to get data to be as usable as possible, for interested parties.

In this set of posts I'll outline a brief overview of how to get from no data infrastructure in place, to having data ready for consumption. I'll try to keep things very high-level. If you are interested in the nitty-gritty, you can always check out the source code for the final project.

With all of that out of the way, let's begin!
